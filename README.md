# photo-and-video-processing
exercises from the "foundations of digital media" course I took

- U1: generates different images
- U2: lets you adjust an image's brightness, contrast, saturation, hue
- U3: converts an image into different grayscales
- U4: different overlays of and transitions between two videos
- U5: high pass filter and low pass filter
- U6: resizes an image (using "nearest neighbour" and "bilinear interpolation")

(Stacks A and B should be used as videos for U4)
